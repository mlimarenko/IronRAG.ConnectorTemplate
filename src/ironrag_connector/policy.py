"""Per-kind push policies.

Every source item has a ``kind`` (page, attachment, image, …). The
operator can choose, for each kind:

* :class:`UpsertAction` — what to do for items the connector has never
  pushed before. ``create`` uploads them; ``skip`` ignores them entirely.
* :class:`UpdateAction` — what to do when an existing item's
  ``change_token`` advanced. ``replace`` pushes a new revision; ``skip``
  leaves the IronRAG document as it was.
* :class:`DeleteAction` — what to do when an item that the framework
  previously saw is no longer in the source. ``delete`` soft-deletes the
  IronRAG document via DELETE /v1/content/documents/{id}; ``ignore``
  leaves it in place.

A fourth knob, ``on_duplicate_content``, decides how the framework reacts
when IronRAG returns 409 ``duplicate content`` on upload — typically the
same byte sequence is already in the library under a different
``external_key``. ``skip`` treats that as a success (the canonical
behavior; identical bytes get deduped by IronRAG); ``fail`` raises so the
operator sees the conflict.

All actions are explicit strings rather than booleans so the YAML config
reads symmetrically and new actions can be added without touching the
schema.
